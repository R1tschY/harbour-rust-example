# Rust example application for Sailfish OS

It is based on the default Sailfish example application for C++. The example uses my `qobject-compiler` project to create an example QObject class. The `sailfishapp` crate is currently needed to integrate with Sailfish. For a more complex example please look at https://github.com/R1tschY/harbour-sailify.
